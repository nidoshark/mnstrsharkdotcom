            I hope everyone had a Happy Holi-Dungeon! We have been taking a bit of a break on <span class="spoiler">the game</span> this past month but we are back at work in the Dungeon. We have some new things to show off this blog so without further ado...
            <br><br>
            Blog Comics!
			<br><br>
            As you saw at the beginning, we are starting to make short 3 panel comics for each blog from now on! The content in these comics will be related to what is shown off in the blog itself! This blog&#39;s comic is illustrated by 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/carewareware">AXOL</a>, but expect future ones to also be illustrated by <a href="https://twitter.com/blargg__">me</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wyanido">NIDO</a> as well. Check out the new Comics page if you want to view any more TDHY comics by themselves! I really hope you enjoy these!

                ''You might have wondered who this little critter in the comics is...''
			</div><br>
			<i>SCAMPS!</i> Native to the Foyer, these lil rascals are awfully crafty, but timid. Their rug-like pattern on their back blends them into the rug below them. Be careful when approaching, Scamps may take a bite and run off!
			<br><br>
			<img src="images/MURDER.gif" class="blog-image-secondary">
			<br><br>
            Aside from their biting, Scamps (like Dwellers) have a knack for treasure, finding items, pickups and even weapons on the ground, and putting them up on their back. Such beauty! Such grace!
            <br><br>
            If you don&#39;t want these fiendish foyer fauna to make off with your hard-earned treasure, be ready to scoop up the treasure or be ready to fight back for it! Because in the Dungeon, it&#39;s finder&#39;s keeper&#39;s!

            This footage and pictures may have got you thinking, “The Foyer looks a bit different since we last saw it” and yes, it is not you going crazy! We did some tweaking to the Foyer&#39;s design, and I have to say, it looks amazing!

			Currently this is all I have to show for this month! We do have more things <a href="images/blog21.png" target="_blank"style="text-decoration:none; color:white;">in the works</a> right now so for now I leave you with a new song tease!

            Here&#39;s to a new, productive year from me and the rest of the TDHY team! See you next month!
