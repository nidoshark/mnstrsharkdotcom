            Welcome to the updated MNSTR Shark site! I had been silently working on this for the most part of 2023 to date (a lot of time spent was occupied by Having A Snooze) so I hope it at least turned out appealing to the few people who will check it out.
            <br><br>
            More importantly, the reason to have a blog at all is that it's nice to have a non-Twittery place to drop updates, especially those less groundbreaking or directly related to the game project.
            <br><br>
            On which note, just when progress had dwindled due to the learning curve of switching game engines a year into development, we received an anonymous package at MNSTR HQ containing nothing but an anvil and the saviour we needed in the form of a blue critter named <a href="https://twitter.com/doodlingmicky">Micky</a>.
            <br><br>
            So here's for the future of the dungeon, and the semi-realistic goal of releasing a demo this year for everybody to enjoy.
