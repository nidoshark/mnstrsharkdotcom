            Despite claims of semi-frequent posting, we disappeared for a month to allocate some time to watch paint on the Dungeon walls dry. sorry

            This delightful track by <a href="https://twitter.com/carewareware">Axol</a>
            plays in the humble abode of a certain red-cloaked Dweller. Many more have been made and are yet to be shared, so please look forward to jamming out the tunes with Delver.
            <br><br>
            In the first year of development, it became a habit to upload progress logs on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nidoshark/videos">NIDO's channel</a> before there was a dedicated <a href=#>Blog</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/mnstrshark>Twitter</a> profile for the game.
            <br><br>
            As the game progressed, it began to feel unnecessary to post every single step of development in sacrifice of the surprise factor the demo will have, but a V5 progress video has been planned for eventual release.

            Welcome to the updated MNSTR Shark site! I had been silently working on this for the most part of 2023 to date (a lot of time spent was occupied by Having A Snooze) so I hope it at least turned out appealing to the few people who will check it out.
            <br><br>
            More importantly, the reason to have a blog at all is that it's nice to have a non-Twittery place to drop updates, especially those less groundbreaking or directly related to the game project.
            <br><br>
            On which note, just when progress had dwindled due to the learning curve of switching game engines a year into development, we received an anonymous package at MNSTR HQ containing nothing but an anvil and the saviour we needed in the form of a blue critter named <a href="https://twitter.com/doodlingmicky">Micky</a>.
            <br><br>
            So here's for the future of the dungeon, and the semi-realistic goal of releasing a demo this year for everybody to enjoy.
