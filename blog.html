            Hello everyone! It's been a hot minute. Actually, it's been a hot several months... In that time, a lot of things happened with the state of <span class="spoiler">the game</span>, <a href="images/divorce.png" target="_blank"style="text-decoration:none; color:white;">the lore</a>, new music, how everything looks and sounds, etc etc.. SO much has happened, you wouldn't believe it. But we're not gonna cover everything at once.
			<br><br>
            We're gonna be talking about NPCs within the Hideout this time! They can give you tools, items, even provide services during a run! If you have the gems to afford it, of course.

                ''Together, we are... The Dungeon Hates You!!!''
			</div><br>
			These services range from <span style="color: #dbdbdb">special potions and food,<span style="color: ORANGE"> custom made cloaks,<span style="color: #8a5527"> forging weapons,<span style="color: #886db5"> selling back weapons you lost on the last run at a noticeably jacked price,<span style="color: #c3f7d0"> full heals,<span style="color: #fa3c3c"> giving you risky debuffs to endure for rewards,<span style="color: GREEN"> gambling all your money,<span style="color: GRAY"> eating all your money.<span style="color: WHITE"> Etc. Etc.

            The Baker makes the finest cuisine out of the <a href="images/the_critter_in_question.png" target="_blank"style="text-decoration:none; color:white;">critters</a> you slaughter. Yummers!!!
            <br><br>
            While some '<a href="images/food.png" target="_blank"style="text-decoration:none; color:white;">food</a>' can be found within the Dungeon itself, be it chests or monster meat, the taste is <a href="images/meal.gif" target="_blank"style="text-decoration:none; color:white;">subpar and foul</a>. You can eat them in a pinch but, if i were you? I'd hold on to it and <a href="images/death.png" target="_blank"style="text-decoration:none; color:white;">bring it back home</a>, you'll never know when he might need more ingredients!

            The Tunneler specializes in excavation, thanks to him digging out the entire No-Through-Grove in an afternoon, Delver can comfortably sleep in his own little bedroom to regain stats and store some items for later. You're gonna have to clean up the place yourself though...
            <br><br>
			He can be found around the Hideout, giving you a tour of the place, catching you up with hundreds of years of absolutely <a href="images/ishould.png" target="_blank"style="text-decoration:none; color:white;">zero progress of freedom</a>. He's also completely useless to you. You'll love him! He's <i>THE</i> tunneler! The iconic Dungeon Hates You character!
			<br><br>
			In other news... We've recruited another fantastic musician for <span class="spoiler">the game</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@chombachoo/videos">Chombachoo</a>'s got just the right sound we need, heres a track he made for a character you'll meet soon.
			<br><br>
			Remember, 99% quit right before they hit it big. <span style="color: GREEN">KEEP GAMBLING.<span style="color: WHITE">

            That's all for now... Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for showing any form of support for our weird little game, we hope to-

			Hold on, what's this?
			<br><br>
			Delver? You... made your own song?
			<br><br>
			You want to show it to the people?
			<br><br>
			Alright, take care everyone, and enjoy Delver's lovely little song.
